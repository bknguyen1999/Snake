This is my version of the Snake game!

All controls and rules are as required via the assignment page.

All backgrounds were found on the internet

The game starts in the splash screen, which shows the player's high scores, and the user gets to decide which level they want to play by pressing the corresponding key.
If the player survives the timer, they will automatically go to the next level, except for level 3 where they play until death.

If the player has died they can replay the same level, go back to the splash screen or quit the game. Quitting the game will take you to an exit screen which displays your high scores.

Note: If the player presses R while they are playing the game, their score will not be saved.
